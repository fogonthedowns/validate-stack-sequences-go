Validate Stack Sequences

Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values, return true if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.

Solution:

1. Use stack data structure
2. Push each value into the stack
3. Greedily pop values from the stack if they are the next value of the pop slice
4. Verify we have popped all the values out
